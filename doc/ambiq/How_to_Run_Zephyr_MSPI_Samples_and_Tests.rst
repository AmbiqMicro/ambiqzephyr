MSPI API Documentation
======================

Introduction
------------
Zephyr MSPI API doc: `Multi-bit SPI Bus â€” Zephyr Project Documentation <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/hardware/peripherals/mspi.html>`_

The MSPI device drivers are split into two parts:

- **Controller drivers**: implement the MSPI API
- **Peripheral device drivers**: use the MSPI API

Board support:

- ``apollo510_eb``
- ``apollo510_evb``
- ``apollo4p_evb``
- ``apollo3p_evb``
- etc.

Examples Overview
-----------------
The following examples may be used to check whether the device and controller are initialized properly.

MEMC Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Performs XIP write and read from the target device and checks if data matches.
- **Note:** This example may run for a long time as it attempts to write the entire region defined by the ``size`` property.

**Build Command:**

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b [board_name] samples/drivers/memc

**Recommendation:**

Enable ``CONFIG_LOG_MODE_IMMEDIATE=y`` to see better log printing.

FLASH Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Performs only 4-byte write and read to a specific flash address.

**Build Command:**

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b [board_name] samples/drivers/mspi/mspi_flash

MSPI API Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Performs basic MSPI controller driver checking.

**Build Command:**

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b [board_name] tests/drivers/mspi/api

MSPI FLASH Test
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Performs single-sector and multiple-sector write and read on the target flash device for 3000 bytes.

**Build Command:**

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b [board_name] samples/drivers/mspi/flash

MSPI Timing Scan Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Performs timing scan for either PSRAM or Flash memory devices.

**Build Commands:**

.. code-block:: bash

   west build -p always -b [board_name] samples/drivers/mspi/mspi_timing_scan -T sample.drivers.mspi.timing_scan.memc

   west build -p always -b [board_name] samples/drivers/mspi/mspi_timing_scan -T sample.drivers.mspi.timing_scan.flash

**Note:**

If you are using a different variant of the APS Z8 PSRAM than the one listed, you need to manually change the ``extra_configs`` in ``sample.yaml``.
