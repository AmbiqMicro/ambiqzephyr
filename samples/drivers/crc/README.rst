CRC Sample
##########

Overview
********

This sample demonstrates how to use the CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) driver API.
The sample calculates CRC32 checksums over test data and displays the results.

Building and Running
********************

This sample can be found under :zephyr_file:`samples/drivers/crc` in the Zephyr tree.

The sample will work on any board that has a CRC driver enabled and configured.
For Ambiq Apollo4P and Apollo510 boards, the sample uses the hardware CRC32 module.

Supported boards:
- apollo4p_evb
- apollo4p_blue_kxr_evb
- apollo510_evb
- apollo510_eb
