The sample demonstrates how to run the `CoreMark®`_ benchmark to evaluate performance of a core.

.. _CoreMark®: https://www.eembc.org/coremark/

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

+---------------------+-------------+
| **Board**           | **Support** |
+=====================+=============+
| nrf52dk_nrf52832    |     Yes     |
| nrf52840dk_nrf52840 |     Yes     |
| nrf5340dk_nrf5340   |     Yes     |
| nrf9160dk_nrf9160   |     Yes     |
| apollo510_evb       |     Yes     |
+---------------------+-------------+

One button and one led are required to run the sample on the board, that is not listed here.

Overview
********

The sample runs the CoreMark benchmark on the target CPU.
CoreMark evaluates the CPU efficiency by performing different algorithms, such as state machine, CRC calculation, matrix manipulation and list processing (find and sort).

To run CoreMark benchmark on the preferred core, press the button that corresponds to the core.
When the benchmark finishes running, it can be started again by pressing the button assigned to the given core.
Button and led assignnment is done in devicetree.

Enable ``COREMARK_MODE_FLASH_AND_RUN`` if you want the sample to run for the first time upon startup.

User interface
**************

Each target CPU has an assigned button and LED that are responsible for triggering the benchmark's start and ``test in progress``.

Default configuration for nRF5340 DK is following:

Button 1:
   Start the benchmark run on the Application Core.
Button 2:
   Start the benchmark run on the Network/Radio Core.
LED 1:
   Indicates ``test in progress`` on the Application Core.
LED 2:
   Indicates ``test in progress`` on the Network/Radio Core.


Configuration
*************

CoreMark runs tests multiple times. The number of iterations is defined with the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_ITERATIONS`` option.
By default, the iteration quantity is set to the minimum time required for valid results.
For valid results, the test should be executed for at least 10 seconds.

CoreMark has three predefined run types, with the predefined data sizes, that are used for data algorithms:

* ``CONFIG_COREMARK_RUN_TYPE_PERFORMANCE`` - defines ``CONFIG_COREMARK_DATA_SIZE`` to 2000 bytes.
* ``CONFIG_COREMARK_RUN_TYPE_PROFILE`` - defines ``CONFIG_COREMARK_DATA_SIZE`` to 1200 bytes.
* ``CONFIG_COREMARK_RUN_TYPE_VALIDATION`` - defines ``CONFIG_COREMARK_DATA_SIZE`` to 500 bytes.

However, you can specify a custom ``CONFIG_COREMARK_DATA_SIZE`` value.
If you want to register your results, see the Submitting Results chapter in the `CoreMark GitHub`_ repository.

Additionally, the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_DATA_SIZE`` option requires available memory space.
By default, the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_MEMORY_METHOD_STACK`` option is selected.
In this case, the main thread stack is used for data allocation.
To change the main stack size, use the ``CONFIG_MAIN_STACK_SIZE`` option.

If you select the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_MEMORY_METHOD_MALLOC`` option, Zephyr :c:func:`k_malloc\k_free` functions will be used to allocate the memory in the heap.
Adjust the heap size with the ``CONFIG_HEAP_MEM_POOL_SIZE`` config option.

If you select the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_MEMORY_METHOD_STATIC`` option, data will be allocated to the RAM as a regular static variable.
In this case you do not need to be aware of the main thread stack size or heap memory pool size.

CoreMark can be executed in a multithread mode.
To specify a number of threads, use the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_THREADS_NUMBER`` option.
You can configure up to four threads.
In the multithread mode, CoreMark is executed in all threads simultaneously.
By default ``CONFIG_TIMESLICE_SIZE`` is set to 10 ms which imitates RTOS multithread usage.
However, in the final report thread execution is combined.
In multithread mode, the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_DATA_SIZE`` option is allocated for each thread separately.
Only the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_MEMORY_METHOD_STACK`` and ``CONFIG_COREMARK_MEMORY_METHOD_MALLOC`` memory methods can be used with multiple threads.
In case of the ``CONFIG_COREMARK_MEMORY_METHOD_STACK`` option, the data for all threads are allocated to the main thread stack.

Building and running
********************

An extra build flag ``CONFIG_COMPILER_OPT="-O3"`` is applied when running the benchmark build to achieve the best CoreMark results.

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/benchmarks/coremark
   :board: nrf52840dk_nrf52840
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

After flashing, messages will appear in the corresponding console that describe the state of the benchmark.
To build for another board, change "nrf52840dk_nrf52840" above to that board's name.

Sample can be built for multiple targets in one run, e.g. in case of multicore MCU using `Sysbuild`_.
Use ``SB_CONFIG_IMAGE_2_BOARD`` option to provide board name for the second image in ``sysbuild.conf``.

To build the sample for the multicore target execute the following commands:

      .. code-block:: console

         west build -b nrf5340dk_nrf5340_cpuapp --sysbuild

Testing
=======

After programming the sample to your development kit, complete the following steps to test it:

1. Connect to the development kit with a terminal emulator (for example, PuTTY).
#. Reset your development kit.
#. To start the test, press the button assigned to the respective core.
   To see the assignment, refer to the User interface section.
   All target cores work independently from each other.
   It is possible to run the benchmark on several cores simultaneously.
   Measurements running on a core will be indicated by the corresponding LED.
   If the ``COREMARK_MODE_FLASH_AND_RUN`` option is enabled, the measurement will launch on the application's start automatically on all available cores.
#. Wait for all measurements to be complete.
   By default test will take approximately 11-13 seconds.
#. Wait for the console output for both cores.
   The results will be similar to the following example:

      .. code-block:: console
